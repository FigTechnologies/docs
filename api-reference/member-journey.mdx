Integrating Fig Finance into your platform involves a standard journey that moves from account creation to loan management.

## 1. Registration & KYC
The journey begins with registering a member. Note that members are created in a `Pending` state and require manual approval from an administrator via the Fig Finance Web Dashboard.

1. **Register Member**: Use `POST /auth/register` with Branch Keys.
2. **Upload Documents**: Submit identity and address proofs via `POST /members/documents`.
3. **Admin Approval**: Wait for status to change to `Active` (1).

## 2. Authentication
Once active, the member can log in to receive a JWT.

1. **Login**: `POST /auth/login` returns the `access_token`.
2. **Authorize**: Use the token in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests.

## 3. Loan Application
After authentication, members can browse available products and apply for loans.

1. **Browse Products**: `GET /loans/products` to see available terms and interest rates.
2. **Apply**: `POST /loans/apply` using a `loan_product_id`.
3. **Detailed Review**: Administrators will review and approve the loan application via the dashboard.

## 4. Repayments
Once a loan is disbursed, the member must manage repayments.

1. **Check Schedule**: `GET /loans/{id}/schedule` to see upcoming payment dates.
2. **Make Payment**: Use `POST /repayments/pay` using available account methods.
3. **Verify History**: `GET /repayments/history` to track all successful installments.

<Tip>
  For a faster integration, use our [Postman Collection](/api-reference/postman) which includes auto-saved variables to handle IDs and tokens across requests.
