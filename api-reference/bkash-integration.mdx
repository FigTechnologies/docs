Fig Finance supports Bkash for both receiving loan repayments and disbursing funds to members.

## Repayments via Bkash

To receive payments from a member's Bkash account:

1. **Create Payment Request**: `POST /bkash/payment/create`
   - Specify the amount and purpose.
2. **Execute Payment**: `POST /bkash/payment/execute`
   - Once the user authorizes the payment on their device.
3. **Query Status**: `POST /bkash/payment/query`
   - Verify the state of the transaction if the execution response is ambiguous.

## Disbursements via Bkash

To send loan funds directly to a member's Bkash wallet:

1. **Create Disbursement**: `POST /bkash/disbursement/create`
2. **Query Disbursement**: `POST /bkash/disbursement/query`
   - Check if the funds have successfully reached the member.

<Warning>
  Ensure your branch has sufficient Bkash float balance before initiating disbursements. Disbursements will fail if the underlying wallet is empty.
</Warning>
